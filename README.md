# 1Church
From the 2015 Code for the Kingdom (C4TK) Hackathon.  1Church displays events from multiple churches on one site.
Users can click on one of these buttons to see events in these categories: 
All Events, Family, Prayer, Finance, Kids, Evangelize, Leadership, Other.

A password-protected Admin site allows for entering, editing, and deleting of events.

The site uses PHP and Bootstrap.
